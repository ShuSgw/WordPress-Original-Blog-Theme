## My web design process

### 1. Planning

**Setting a Goal** - The purpose of building up this website is to make a blog theme that I can use for my blog.

**Color** - Blue and white color make the website simple and clean. Then, I believe that it imporove its legibility.

## Future Improvements

- Using a JavaScript compilete module to make my JavaScript legible.
- Change functions into Objects and delete multiple functions that have similer purposes.
- Naming CSS classes based on CSS Architecture Methodology such as BEM, SMACSS, and OOCSS
